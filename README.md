#Open NGO 
OpenNGO supports the open-information initiative of HelpArgentina, an Argentine charity working to strengthen Argentina’s social sector.  This website will provide donors and other socially-minded citizens unprecedented access to data on Argentine non-profits.  Users can search for organizations and read about their programs, teams, financials and more.  The site’s clean layout, solr-powered search, developer API and .xls download features all enhance the organization’s mission of increased NGO transparency.
